Reports:

1) HLR
2) Testcase
3) TestScenario
4) Defect Report

QA -> Quality Assurance Engineer
QC -> Quality Control Enginneer
Tester -> Software testing,Manual Testing

Activity : Activity 
Process : 4 process = 1 activity

Lifecycle:
SDLC -> Software Development Lifecycle
STLC -> Software Testing Lifecycle

Static Testing :
It can test and find defects without executing code

Dynamic Testing :In dynamic testing the software code is executed to
demonstrate the result of running tests.

SDLC Stages:

1)Reuirement Gathering
2)Analysis
3)Design
4)Implementation->Coding
5)Testing
6)Maintenance
